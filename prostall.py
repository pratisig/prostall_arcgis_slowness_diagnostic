r"""Diagnose why ArcGIS Pro is slow on this workstation, and never report a finding the machine did not produce.

An editor says Pro takes five minutes to open, hangs mid-edit, and sometimes
her saved edits are gone. There is no error message. The causes are spread
across the registry, the filesystem, OneDrive's redirection state, Offline
Files and the per-app GPU preference, and no single pane shows them together.
The deeper problem is the diagnostic itself. A check that prints a verdict on
something it never measured teaches the operator to distrust the whole report,
and the report is the only thing standing between her and a rebuild.

ArcGIS Pro ships a Diagnostic Monitor, and it is the right tool for what it
does: it traces Pro from inside the process, timestamps every event, and hands
Esri support a log they can read. It cannot see the workstation. Known Folder
Move, a dehydrated project file, Offline Files, the GPU Windows chose, the
storage class of the project folder - all of that is outside the process, and a
session that never finished opening produces no trace at all. That is the gap
this fills, from the outside, before the case is opened.

Check by default. A plain run reads and prints. --apply is the only path that
changes machine state, every applied change prints its own undo, and nothing
here deletes anything. The network probes are opt-in: without --sde-server and
--portal no host is contacted. The one exception is a project folder that
already lives on a share: reading it crosses the network, as Pro does when it
opens the project, and PF-03 times one listing of it.

    python prostall.py --self-test
    python prostall.py
    python prostall.py --sde-server gisdb01 --portal gis.example.org --verbose
    python prostall.py --report C:\Temp\properf
    python prostall.py --apply

Exit codes: 0 nothing to act on, 1 performance findings only, 2 at least one
finding bearing on lost edits, 3 no finding but nothing was determined either,
64 usage error or a report that could not be written.
